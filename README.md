## 🎯 Institutional Demo Walkthrough

### Stage 1: The Identity Vault
Visit the **Login** page. Experience the "True Black" premium aesthetic. Create a secure identity via **Signup** to enter the Intelligence Platform.

### Stage 2: Dashboard Overview (Market vs Intrinsic)
Upon entry, the system immediately compares the **Current Market Price** (₹7200) against our **Intrinsic Value Model** (₹6378). A clear recommendation (HOLD/BUY/SELL) is generated based on the professional margin of safety.

### Stage 3: The Financial Continuum
Navigate to the **Forecast** tab. Observe the seamless transition from **Audited History** (Solid lines) to **Professional Projections** (Dashed lines). This visual integrity satisfies institutional trust standards.

### Stage 4: Valuation Bridge
Examine the **Valuation breakdown**. The platform provides a visual "bridge" from Enterprise Value to Net Debt and ultimately to Equity Value per share.

### Stage 5: AI Explanation
Open the **Intelligence Bot**. Ask: *"Explain why the WACC is set at 12.5%?"*. The bot will provide a data-driven explanation directly from the model assumptions.

## 🏛️ Project Principles
1. **Trust Over Trading**: Zero technical indicators (RSI/MACD). Focus is purely on fundamental value.
2. **Visual Integrity**: Dashed lines for future, Solid for past.
3. **No Frontend Math**: 100% of financial calculations are performed on the secure server.
4. **Institutional Aesthetic**: Professional, neutral, and high-contrast #050505 "True Black" design.
